So...

Carrier frequenzy... 
It's basically: "on, off, off, off", repeated 32 times per high half bit.

IR needs the carrier (in theory at least).
The _working_ir_main.go contains code that works with an IR LED.

RCA Wired Remote Control protocol won't work at all with the carrier.
The _working_wired_main.go contains code that works with wired protocol.
It's just the _working_ir_main.go, but with the code for 3/4 silence commented out.

It should be possible to significantly simplify the code,
if it only needs to support the wired protocol.
